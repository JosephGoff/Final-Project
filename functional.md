# Minesweeper Game 



## Functional Specification

- This game uses a recurrent function to refresh the board each time the user presses a specific key and displays various changes based on the key they press and the random design of the board. 
- The user can access the game by downloading the text from a text editor and calling it in the mac terminal:
		For example: if code is saved to downloads, go to terminal and type “cd downloads” and then type “python ‘name_of_file’” 
- The user always sees the same display board, although its interior changes as you perform actions throughout the game. 
- This game uses one screen which can be altered by pressing single key commands. These elements include pound signs being flagged or uncovered to reveal a mine, a number, or an empty space. 
- This program doesn’t use the mouse; instead, the arrows can be used to move from space to space on the displayed board.
- No graphic assets were used to display the board or play the game. 
- No installation is required, although it may require a downloaded python app to download the file to be run in the terminal.
